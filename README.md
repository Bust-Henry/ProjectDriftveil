# ProjectDriftveil

**Attention!**
**This project is still in development and not even closed to be finished. So dont expect it to work right out of the box!**

## Project discription
This project was created to share your Pokemon Home account with your friendgroup in order to collect, build competetive teams and complete challenges together!

Initially I started this project to build a living dex with my friends, but there are many more things you can do with this application. If you want to share pokemon with your friends or maybe even with a community, you came to the right place.

## What is included in this project?
- A database that contains all pokemon you have in your pokemon home account
- A bot that can read any changes you make to your collection of pokemon
- A webserver (flask server) that hosts a simple [api](https://github.com/Bust-Henry/ProjectDriftveil/wiki/API) to retrieve or set data in your database
- A [discordbot](https://github.com/Bust-Henry/ProjectDriftveil/wiki/Discord-Bot) that wraps this api
